# Landing Page - The Odin Project

In this project I'm supossed to prove all I've been learning through the curriculum.

From the last project, I've learned the basics of CSS, but the topic will take more relevance for this project is Flexbox, this will be very useful to make things easier. Now, let's consider I haven't learned about Responsive design, so the final webpage is not intended to work in mobile devices.
